Welcome to imPACT! 

Building good habits that last is not an easy feat. The key to successfully building a lasting habit is to associate the habit to a new identity. Identity-based habits have a greater likelihood of lasting long term because they are more closely tied to how an individual is defined. An identity-based habit focuses on what kind of person you want to become and operates on the level of belief change.

The name “imPACT” has multiple meanings. Good habits can have a major impact on long term success. The prefix “im” represents self and who we wish to become, such as “I am a great programmer”. Pact represents an agreement with oneself or with others (accountability buddies) to stick to these habits that will lead us to the identity (goal) that we desire. 

This application uses “identity” as the connection between users and habits. A user has many habits through a, identity. It allows a user to create an identity and a habit and associate the two. Users who have a similar goal can join in on an identity and form pact. From the habits a user associates with an identity, action steps can be created to help break the habit into smaller and very specific steps in order to start the habit formation. For instance, using the previous identity of “I am a great programmer” could have a habit of “code often”. An action step will take this habit and break it into precise steps: “I will work on a coding challenge before work at home at 5am on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 2 hours. This sets a specific intention for the task at hand.
